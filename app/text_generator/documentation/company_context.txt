**Company Mission and History**

PayApp, a fintech startup company, was founded in 2021 with a clear mission: to provide a convenient and user-friendly way for people to make payments. The company's main offering is an in-house mobile application, available on both iOS and Android operating systems. By developing innovative payment solutions, PayApp aims to simplify transactions and improve financial accessibility for all.

**Company Business Model**

PayApp operates as a limited liability company (LLC) registered in Delaware, United States.
