We are dedicated to attracting, developing, and retaining top talent who share our passion for revolutionizing the way people make payments. By placing a strong focus on employee satisfaction, well-being, and growth, we aim to create a cohesive and motivated workforce that drives the success of PayApp.\n\n### Defined Policies for Vacations, Personal Time Off, and Benefits\n\n##### Vacation Policy\n\nAt PayApp, we believe in the importance of work-life balance and understand the value of taking time off to unwind and rejuvenate. All employees are entitled to a set amount of vacation days annually, which can be used for personal leisure or any other purpose deemed necessary. The specific number of vacation days varies based on factors such as tenure, job level, and local legal requirements.\n\nTo request vacation time, employees should submit their request through our internal HR system, indicating the desired dates and duration. Although we strive to accommodate everyone's preferences, approval is subject to management's discretion and operational requirements. Employees are encouraged to plan their vacations in advance and ensure proper coordination with their team members to minimize any disruption in workflow.\n\n##### Personal Time Off (PTO) Policy\n\nIn addition to vacation days, PayApp provides employees with personal time off for various reasons, such as personal appointments, family obligations, or unforeseen circumstances. The PTO policy allows employees to take a certain number of days off per year, which is separate from vacation days. The specific number of PTO days granted to each employee may vary based on factors including job level and local legal requirements.\n\nSimilar to vacation days, employees must submit their PTO requests through the HR system, clearly stating the reason and preferred dates. Management will review each request on a case-by-case basis, taking into account operational needs, team schedules, and fairness among employees. While we strive to accommodate employees' PTO needs, approval is subject to managerial discretion.\n\n##### Benefits\n\nAt PayApp, we understand the importance of comprehensive benefits to support our employees' well-being and provide peace of mind. We offer a range of benefits to our employees, including but not limited to:\n\n1. Health Insurance: PayApp provides health insurance coverage, ensuring that employees have access to quality healthcare for themselves and their eligible dependents. The specific coverage details may vary based on regional regulations and employee requirements.\n\n2. Retirement Plans: We believe in helping employees secure their financial future, and thus offer retirement plans such as a 401(k) or similar schemes. Through these plans, employees can voluntarily contribute a portion of their salary to a retirement savings account, with the option for employer-matching contributions.\n\n3. Paid Leave: PayApp supports employees during significant life events like parenthood by providing paid parental leave. The duration and conditions may vary based on local legal requirements and individual circumstances.\n\n4. Wellness Programs: We recognize the importance of maintaining a healthy work-life balance, both physically and mentally. PayApp organizes various wellness initiatives and programs to support employees' well-being, ranging from fitness or wellness allowances to mental health resources.\n\n5. Employee Assistance Programs (EAP): PayApp offers confidential counseling services and resources for employees dealing with personal or work-related challenges. Our EAP provides professional assistance and support to promote a healthy work environment.\n\nThese benefits demonstrate our commitment to creating a positive and supportive work culture, empowering employees to thrive both professionally and personally.\n\n### Leader of the Department\n\nThe People Department at PayApp is led by Janeth Reyes, the Head of People.
